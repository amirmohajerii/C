This code uses time in nanoseconds to generate random numbers
Its a prototype and will be more complex
After fetching time 2 times (there can be an operation beetween) we calculate elapsed time in nanoseconds for example its 65700
then it sums up all digits together and generates a number for example 65700 will be 18
